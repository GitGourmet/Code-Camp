      <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) was an American biologist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work in developing high-yielding wheat varieties. Borlaug's work is credited with saving millions of lives and preventing widespread famine in Mexico, India, Pakistan, and other countries. He is often called the "father of the Green Revolution," and his work has had a profound impact on agriculture and food production around the world.</p>
